A very basic combination of `React` + `Semi Design UI` + `JakartaEE Tomcat 10`

*My Résumé* 

## Setup frontend server

```bash
$ yarn
# After package installing...
$ yarn start
# The server is staring...
```

## Setup backend server

> SDK used: `JDK 11 (Temurin) + Jakarta EE`
>
> Server: `Tomcat 10.0.1`

Project modules are maintained with Mavem, the preferred way is to configure Tomcat Server on an IDE for starting Java Project.

The localhost port should be `8080` in comply with frontend functionality.
